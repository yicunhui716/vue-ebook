In view of this, some have taken the opportunity to revive the scholastic Argument from Design, whereas others have felt the need to explain this apparent fine-tuning of the clockwork of the Universe by proposing the existence of a ‘Multiverse’. We analyze this issue from a sober perspective. Having reviewed the literature and having added several observations of our own, we conclude that cosmic fine-tuning supports neither Design nor a Multiverse, since both of these fail at an explanatory level as well as in the more quantitative context of Bayesian confirmation theory (although there might be other reasons to believe in these ideas, to be found in religion and in inflation and/or string theory, respectively). In fact, fine-tuning and Design even seem to be at odds with each other, whereas the inference from fine-tuning to a Multiverse only works if the latter is underwritten by an additional metaphysical hypothesis we consider unwarranted. Instead, we suggest that fine-tuning requires no special explanation at all, since it is not the Universe that is fine-tuned for life, but life that has been fine-tuned to the Universe.</p></section><!--End Abstract--><div class="Fulltext"><section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec1"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">1 </span>Introduction</h2><div class="Para" id="Par2">Twentieth Century physics and cosmology have revealed an astonishing path towards our existence, which appears to be predicated on a delicate interplay between the three fundamental forces that govern the behavior of matter at very small distances and the long-range force of gravity.

</p></section><section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec2"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2 </span>Evidence for Fine-Tuning</h2><p class="Para" id="Par28">Thanks to impressive progress in both cosmology and (sub) nuclear physics, over the second half of the 20th Century it began to be realized that the above scenario is predicated on seemingly exquisite fine-tuning of some of the constants of Nature and initial conditions of the Universe. We just give some of the best known and best understood cases here.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn10" id="Fn10_source">10</a></sup>
</p><p class="Para" id="Par30">One of the first examples was the ‘Beryllium bottleneck’ studied by Hoyle in 1951, which is concerned with the mechanism through which stars produce carbon and oxygen.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn11" id="Fn11_source">11</a></sup> This was not only a major correct scientific prediction based on ‘anthropic reasoning’ in the sense that some previously unknown physical effect (viz. the energy level in question) <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">had</em> to exist in order to explain some crucial condition for life; it involves dramatic fine-tuning, too, in that the nucleon-nucleon force must lie near its actual strength within about one part in a thousand in order to obtain the observed abundances of carbon and oxygen, which happen to be the right amounts needed for life (Ekström et al. <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR27">2010</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par32">Another well-understood example from nuclear physics is the mass difference between protons and neutrons, or, more precisely, between the down quark and the up quark (Hogan <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR39">2000</a></span>).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn12" id="Fn12_source">12</a></sup> This mass difference is positive (making the neutron heavier than the proton); if it weren’t, the proton would fall apart and there would be no chemistry as we know it. On the other hand, the difference can’t be too large, for otherwise stars (or hydrogen bombs, for that matter) could not be fueled by nuclear fusion and stars like our Sun would not exist.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn13" id="Fn13_source">13</a></sup> Both require a fine-tuning of the mass difference by about 10 %.</p><p class="Para" id="Par35">Moving from fundamental forces to initial conditions, the solar system seems fine-tuned for life in various ways, most notably in the distance between the Sun and the Earth: if this had been greater (or smaller) by at most a few precent it would have been too cold (or too hot) for at least complex life to develop. Furthermore, to that effect the solar system must remain stable for billions of years, and after the first billion years or so the Earth should not be hit by comets or asteroids too often. Both conditions are sensitive to the precise number and configuration of the planets (Ward and Brownlee <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR90">2000</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par36">Turning from the solar system to initial conditions of our Universe, but still staying safely within the realm of well-understood physics and cosmology, Rees (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR70">1999</a></span>) and others have drawn attention to the fine-tuning of another cosmological number called <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em>, which gives the size of inhomogeneities, or ‘ripples’, in the early Universe and is of the order <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Q</em> ~ 0.00001, or one part in a hundred thousand.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn14" id="Fn14_source">14</a></sup> This parameter is fine-tuned by a factor of about ten on both sides (Rees <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR70">1999</a></span>; Tegmark et al. <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR85">2006</a></span>): if it had been less than a tenth of its current value, then no galaxies would have been formed (and hence no stars and planets). If, on the other hand, it had been more than ten times its actual value, then matter would have been too lumpy, so that there wouldn’t be any stars (and planets) either, but only black holes. Either way, a key condition for life would be violated.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn15" id="Fn15_source">15</a></sup>
</p><p class="Para" id="Par39">The expansion of the Universe is controlled by a number called Ω, defined as the ratio between the actual matter density in the Universe and the so-called critical density. If Ω ≤ 1, then the Universe would expand forever, whereas Ω > 1 would portend a recollapse. Thus Ω = 1 is a critical point.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn16" id="Fn16_source">16</a></sup> It is remarkable enough that currently Ω ≈ 1 (within a few percent); what is astonishing is that this is the case at such a high age of the Universe. Namely, for Ω to retain its (almost) critical value for billions of years, it must have had this value right from the very beginning to a precision of at least 55 decimal places.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn17" id="Fn17_source">17</a></sup>
</p><p class="Para" id="Par42">This leads us straight to Einstein’s cosmological constant Λ, which he introduced into his theory of gravity in 1917 in order to (at least theoretically) stabilize the Universe against contracting or expanding, to subsequently delete it in 1929 after Hubble’s landmark observation of the expansion of the Universe (famously calling its introduction his “biggest blunder”). Ironically, Λ made a come-back in 1998 as the leading theoretical explanation of the (empirical) discovery that the expansion of the Universe is currently accelerating.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn18" id="Fn18_source">18</a></sup> For us, the point is that even the currently accepted value of Λ remains very close to zero, whereas according to (quantum field) theory it should be about 55 (some even say 120) orders of magnitude larger (Martin <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR55">2012</a></span>). This is often seen as a fine-tuning problem, because some compensating mechanism must be at work to cancel its very large natural value with a precision of (once again) 55 decimal places.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn19" id="Fn19_source">19</a></sup></p><p class="Para" id="Par45">The fine-tuning of all numbers considered so far seems to be dwarfed by a knock-down FTA given by Roger Penrose (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR64">1979</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR65">2004</a></span>), who claims that in order to produce a Universe that even very roughly looks like ours, its initial conditions (among some generic set) must have been fine-tuned with a precision of one to <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1"><img alt="$$10^{{10^{123} }}$$" src="../images/340096_1_En_6_Chapter/340096_1_En_6_Chapter_TeX_IEq1.png" style="height:2.55em"/></span>, arguably the largest number ever conceived: all atoms in the Universe would not suffice to write it out in full.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn20" id="Fn20_source">20</a></sup> Penrose’s argument is an extreme version of an idea originally due to Boltzmann, who near the end of the 19th Century argued that the direction of time is a consequence of the increase of entropy in the future but not in the past,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn21" id="Fn21_source">21</a></sup> which requires an extremely unlikely initial state (Price <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR69">1997</a></span>; Uffink <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR86">2007</a></span>; Lebowitz <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR46">2008</a></span>). However, this kind of reasoning is as brilliant as it is controversial (Callendar <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR15">2004</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR16">2010</a></span>; Earman <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR25">2006</a></span>; Eckhardt <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR26">2006</a></span>; Wallace <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR88">2010</a></span>; Schiffrin and Wald <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR73">2012</a></span>). More generally, the more extreme the asserted fine-tuning is, the more adventurous the underlying arguments are (or so we think).</p><p class="Para" id="Par48">To be on the safe side, the fine-tuning of Ω, Λ, and Penrose’s initial condition should perhaps be ignored, leaving us with the other examples, and a few similar ones not discussed here. But these should certainly suffice to make a case for fine-tuning that is serious enough to urge the reader to at least make a bet on one the five options listed above.</p></section><section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec3"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">3 </span>General Arguments</h2><div class="Para" id="Par49">Before turning to a specific discussion of the Design and the Multiverse proposals, we make a few critical (yet impartial) remarks that put the FTA in perspective (see also Sober <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR79">2004</a></span>; Manson <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR53">2009</a></span>). Adherents of the FTA typically use analogies like the following:<div class="UnorderedList"><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet"><li><p class="Para" id="Par50">Someone lays out a deck of 52 cards after it has been shuffled. If the cards emerge in some canonical order (e.g., the Ace of Spades down to 2, then the Ace of Hearts down to 2, etc.), then, on the tacit assumption that each outcome is equally (un)likely, this very particular outcome supposedly cannot have been due to ‘luck’ or chance.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par51">Alternatively, if a die is tossed a large number of times and the number 6 comes up every time, one would expect the die to be loaded, or the person who cast it to be a very skillful con man. Once again, each outcome was <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">assumed</em> equally likely.</p></li></ul></div>
</div><p class="Para" id="Par52">First, there is an underlying assumption in the FTA to the effect that the ‘constants’ of Nature as well as the initial conditions of the Universe (to both of which the emergence of life is allegedly exquisitely sensitive) are similarly variable. This may or may not be the case; the present state of science is not advanced enough to decide between chance and necessity concerning the laws of nature and the beginning of the Universe.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn22" id="Fn22_source">22</a></sup>
</p><p class="Para" id="Par54">Second, granted that the ‘constants’ etc. are variable in principle (in the sense that values other than the current ones preserve the existence and consistency of the theories in which they occur), it is quite unclear to what extent they can vary and which variations may be regarded as ‘small’; yet the FTA relies on the assumption that even ‘small’ variations would block the emergence of life (Manson <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR51">2000</a></span>). In the absence of such information, it would be natural to assume that any (real, positive as appropriate) value may be assumed, but in that case mathematical probabilistic reasoning (which is necessary for the FTA in order to say that the current values are ‘unlikely’) turns out to be impossible (McGrew et al. <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR57">2001</a></span>; Colyvan et al. <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR19">2005</a></span>; Koperski <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR44">2005</a></span>).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn23" id="Fn23_source">23</a></sup> But also if a large but finite number of values (per constant or initial condition) needs be taken into account, it is hard to assign any kind of probability to any of the alternative values; even the assumption that each values is equally likely seems totally arbitrary (Everitt <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR29">2004</a></span>; Norton <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR62">2010</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par56">Nonetheless, these problems may perhaps be overcome and in any case, for the sake of argument we will continue to use the metaphors opening this section.</p></section><section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec4"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">4 </span>Critiquing the Inference of Design from Fine-Tuning</h2><p class="Para" id="Par57">The idea that cosmic fine-tuning originates in design by something like an intelligent Creator fits into a long-standing Judeo-Christian tradition, where both the Cosmos and biology were explained in that way.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn24" id="Fn24_source">24</a></sup> Now that biology has yielded to the theory of Evolution proposed by Darwin and Wallace in the mid 19th Century,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn25" id="Fn25_source">25</a></sup> the battleground has apparently moved back to the cosmos. Also there, Design remains a vulnerable idea.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn26" id="Fn26_source">26</a></sup> For the sake of argument we do not question the coherence of the idea of an intelligent Creator as such, although such a spirit seems chimerical (Everitt <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR29">2004</a></span>; Philipse <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR66">2012</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par61">First, in slightly different ways Smith (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR77">1993</a></span>) and Barnes (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR4">2012</a></span>) both made the point that the FTA does not claim, or support the conclusion, that the present Universe is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">optimal</em> for intelligent life. Indeed, it hardly seems to be: even granted all the fine-tuning in the world as well as the existence of our earth with its relatively favorable conditions (Ward and Brownlee <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR90">2000</a></span>), evolution has been walking a tightrope so as to produce as much as jellyfish, not to speak of primates (Dawkins <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR22">1996</a></span>). This fact alone casts doubt on the FTA as an Argument of Design, for surely a benign Creator would prefer a Universe optimal for life, rather than one that narrowly permits it? From a theistic perspective it would seem far more efficient to have a cosmic architecture that is robust for its designated goal.</p><p class="Para" id="Par62">Second, the inference to Design from the FTA seems to rest on a decisive tacit assumption whose exposure sustantially weakens this inference (Bradley <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR12">2001</a></span>).

The FTA is predicated on such marking, which already <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">presupposes</em> that life is special.</p><p class="Para" id="Par64">It is irrelevant to this objection whether or not life is indeed special; the point is that the assumption that life be special has to be made <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">in addition</em> to the FTA in order to launch the latter on track to Design. But the inference from the (assumed) speciality of life to Design hardly needs the FTA: even if all values of the constants and initial conditions would lead to a life-permitting Universe, those who think that life is special would presumably point to a Creator. In fact, both by the arguments recalled at the beginning of this section and those below, their case would actually be considerably stronger than the FTA.</p><p class="Para" id="Par65">In sum, fine-tuning is not by itself sufficient as a source for an Argument of Design; it is the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">combination</em> with an assumption to the effect that life is somehow singled out, preferred, or special.

The claim is that there are innumerable Universes (jointly forming a ‘Multiverse’), each having its own ‘constants’ of Nature and initial conditions, so that, unlikely as the life-inducing values of these constants and conditions in our Universe may be, they simply <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">must</em> occur within this unfathomable plurality. The point, then, is that we have to observe precisely those values because in other Universes there simply are no observers. This principle has been labeled both ‘tautological’ and ‘unscientific’. Some love it and some hate it, but we do not need to take sides in this debate: all we wish to do is find out whether or not the FTA speaks in favour of a Multiverse, looking at both an explanatory and a probabilistic level. Thus the question is whether the (alleged) fact of fine-tuning is (at least to some extent) explained by a Multiverse, or if, in the context of Bayesian confirmation theory, the evidence of fine-tuning increases the probability of the hypothesis that a Multiverse exists.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn30" id="Fn30_source">30</a></sup> To get the technical discussion going, the following metaphors have been used:<div class="UnorderedList"><ul class="UnorderedListMarkBullet"><li><p class="Para" id="Par74">Rees’s ‘off the shelf’ clothes shop has already been mentioned in the Introduction: if someone enters a shop that sells suits in one size only (i.e., a single Universe), it would be amazing if it fitted (i.e., enabled life).

This amounts to fine-tuning for life in a single Universe. The thrust of the metaphor arises when the lucky executee is the sole survivor among a large number of other convicts, most or all of whom are killed (analogously to the other branches of the Multiverse, most or all of which are inhospitable to life). The idea is that although each convict had a small a priori probability of not being hit, if there are many of them these small individual probabilities of survival add up to a large probability that <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">someone</em> survives.</p></li><li><p class="Para" id="Par76">Bradley (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR10">2009</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR11">2012</a></span>) considers an urn that is filled according to a random procedure:</p><div class="Para" id="Par77">

</div><p class="Para" id="Par80">Using a biased drawing procedure that could only yield either a small ball or nothing, a small ball is obtained (playing the role of a life-enabling Universe). A simple Bayesian computation shows that this outcome confirms Tails for the initial flip.</p><p class="Para" id="Par81">Each of these stories is insightful and worth contemplating. For example, the first one nicely contrasts the Multiverse with Design, which would correspond to bespoke tailoring and hence, at least from a secular point of view, commits the fallacy of putting the customer (i.e., life) first, instead of the tailor (i.e., the Universe as it is). The Dostoyevskian character of the second highlights the Anthropic Principle, whose associated selection effects (Bostrom <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR7">2002</a></span>) are also quantitatively taken into account by the third.</p><p class="Para" id="Par82">Nonetheless, on closer inspection each is sufficiently vulnerable to fail to clinch the issue in favour of the Multiverse. One point is that although each author is well aware of (and the second and the third even respond to) the <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Inverse Gambler’s Fallacy</em> (Hacking <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR35">1987</a></span>),<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn31" id="Fn31_source">31</a></sup> this fallacy is not really avoided (White <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR94">2000</a></span>). In its simplest version, this is the mistake made by a gambler who enters a casino or a pub, notices that a double six is thrown at some table, and asks if this is the first roll of the evening (his underlying false assumption being that this particular outcome is more likely if many rolls preceded it). Despite claims to the contrary (Leslie <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR47">1988</a></span>; Manson and Thrush <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR54">2003</a></span>; Bradley <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR10">2009</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR11">2012</a></span>), Hacking’s analysis that this is precisely the error made by those who favor a Multiverse based on the FTA in our opinion still stands. For example, in Rees’ analogy of the clothes shop, what needs to be explained is not that <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">some</em> suit in the shop turns out to fit the customer, but that the one <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">he happens to be standing in front of</em> does. Similarly, the probability that a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">given</em> executee survives is independent of whoever else is going to be shot in the same round. And finally, the relevant urn metaphor is not the one described above, but the one in which Tails leads to the filling of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">two</em> different urns with one ball each. Proponents of a Multiverse correctly state that its existence would increase the probability of life existing in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">some</em> Universe,<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn32" id="Fn32_source">32</a></sup> but this is only relevant to the probability of life in <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">this</em> Universe if one identifies <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">any</em> Universe with the same properties as ours with <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">our</em> Universe.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn33" id="Fn33_source">33</a></sup> Such an identification may be suggested by the (weak) Anthropic Principle, but its is by no means implied by it, and one should realize that the inference of a Multiverse from the FTA implicitly hinges on this additional assumption.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn34" id="Fn34_source">34</a></sup>
</p><p class="Para" id="Par87">Moving from a probabilistic to an explanatory context, we follow Mellor (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR58">2002</a></span>) in claiming that if anything, a Multiverse would make fine-tuning even more puzzling. Taking the firing squad analogy, there is no doubt that the survival of a single executee is unexpected, but the question is whether it may be explained (or, at least, whether it becomes less unexpected) by the assumption that simultaneously, many other ‘successful’ executions were taking place. From the probabilistic point of view discussed above, their presence should have no bearing on the case of the lone survivor, whose luck remains as amazing as it was. From another, explanatory point of view, <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">it makes his survival even more puzzling</em>, since we now know from this additional information about the other executions that apparently the marksmen usually do kill their victims.</p></section><section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec6"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">6 </span>Conclusion</h2><div class="Para" id="Par88">Already the uncontroversial examples that feed the FTA suffice to produce the fascinating insight that the formal structure of our current theories of (sub)nuclear physics and cosmology (i.e., the Standard Model of particle physics and Einstein’s theory of General Relativity) is insufficient to predict the rich phenomenology these theories give rise to: the precise values of most (if not all) constants and initial conditions play an equally decisive role. This is a recent insight: even a physicist having the stature of Nobel Laureate Glashow (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR33">1999</a></span>, p. 80) got this wrong, having initially paraphrased the situation well:<blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p class="Para" id="Par89">“Imagine a television set with lots of knobs: for focus, brightness, tint, contrast, bass, treble, and so on.

For one thing, as we argued, at best they fail to have any explanatory or probabilistic thrust (unless they rely on precarious additional assumptions), and at worst fine-tuning actually seems to turn against them.</p><p class="Para" id="Par93">Most who agree with this verdict would probably feel left with a choice between the options of <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Blind Chance</em> and <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">Blind Necessity</em>; the present state of science does not allow us to make such a choice now (at least not rationally), and the question even arises if science will ever be able to make it (in a broader context), except perhaps philosophically (e.g., à la Kant). However, we would like to make a brief case for the fifth position, stating that the fine-tuning problem is <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">misguided</em> and that all we need to do is to clear away confusion.</p><p class="Para" id="Par94">There are analogies and differences between cosmic fine-tuning for life through the laws of Nature and the initial conditions of the Universe, as discussed so far, and Evolution in the sense of Darwin and Wallace. The latter is based on random (genetic) variation, survival of the fittest, and heritability of fitness. All these are meant to apply locally, i.e., to life on Earth. We personally feel that arguments to extend these principles to the Universe in the sense that the Cosmos may undergo some kind of ‘biological’ evolution, having descendants born in singularities, perhaps governed by different laws and initial conditions (some of which, then, might be ‘fine-tuned for life’, as in the Multiverse argument), as argued by e.g., Wheeler (in Ch. 44 of Misner et al. <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR59">1973</a></span>) and Smolin (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR78">1997</a></span>), imaginative as they may be, are too speculative to merit serious discussion. Instead, the true analogy seems to be as follows: as far as the emergence and subsequent evolution of life are concerned, the Universe and our planet Earth should simply be taken as given.

We observe that some things which lack awareness, namely natural bodies, act for the sake of an end. This is clear because they always or commonly act in the same manner to achieve what is best, which shows that they reach their goal not by chance but because they tend towards it. Now things which lack awareness do not tend towards a goal unless directed by something with awareness and intelligence, like an arrow by an archer. Therefore there is some intelligent being by whom everything in nature is directed to a goal, and this we call ‘God’.” Translation in Kenny (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR43">1969</a></span>, p. 96), to whom we also refer for a critical review of Aquinas’s proofs of the existence of God. It is a moot point whether the Fifth Way is really an example of the medieval Argument of Design, which Aquinas expresses elsewhere as: “The arrangement of diverse things cannot be dictated by their own private and divergent natures; of themselves they are diverse and exhibit no tendency to form a pattern. It follows that the order of many among themselves is either a matter of chance or must be attributed to one first planner who has a purpose in mind.” (Kenny <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR43">1969</a></span>, p. 116). Everitt (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR29">2004</a></span>) distinguishes between the Argument <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">to</em> Design and the Argument <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">from</em> Order, respectively, both of which may still be found in modern Christian apologists such as Swinburne (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR84">2004</a></span>), Küng (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR45">2005</a></span>), and Collins (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR18">2009</a></span>), rebutted by e.g., Everitt (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR29">2004</a></span>) and Philipse (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR66">2012</a></span>).

Throughout early modern science, the gradual ‘reading’ of the ‘Book of Nature’, seen as a second ‘book’ God had left mankind next to the Bible, was implicitly or explicitly seen as a confirmation of Design (Jorink <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR42">2010</a></span>).
