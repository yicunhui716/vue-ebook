We use game theory, the mathematical study of interactive decision making, to explain the role of rationality and randomness in strategic behavior. In many of these situations, humans deliberately create randomness as a best response and equilibrium strategy. Moreover, once out of equilibrium, individual beliefs about the real intentions of others introduce significant randomness into otherwise quite simple and deterministic situations of interaction. In a second step we discuss the role of randomness on financial markets, which are prototypical institutions for the aggregation of individual behavior. As in certain simple games, financial markets can produce outcomes that are close to perfect randomness. In fact, random walks in financial returns are considered by most scholars to be efficient and desirable. Finally, we apply game theoretical insights to behavior on financial markets and show how strategic speculation on ‘greater fools’ can create a ‘madness of crowds’ that often ends in chaotic swings, bubbles and crashes.</p></section><!--End Abstract--><div class="Fulltext"><section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec1"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">1 </span>Introduction</h2><p class="Para" id="Par2">In 1720, Sir Isaac Newton was heavily invested in the South Sea bubble. When the stock bubble burst he lost a fortune of about £2.4 million (in present day terms) and was quoted as stating: “I can calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of crowds”.</p><p class="Para" id="Par3">The interaction between humans does indeed often appear like madness, governed by error and randomness. There is, however, a scientific field that attempts to logically explain human interaction. Game theory is the mathematical study of interactive decision making and it has revolutionized the way we see and understand economics, politics, financial markets, and many other aspects of human society. Game theory also applies to other species than humans and has made important contributions in, for example, biology.</p><p class="Para" id="Par4">This chapter will introduce simple game theoretical concepts and financial market applications to explain how we interact in certain situations and what role randomness plays in our behavior. The central question is how people deal with strategic uncertainty, which is the uncertainty about other people’s expectations and actions that we face in human interaction. We then apply this approach to financial markets and discuss how heterogeneous beliefs and errors in updating can create feedback cycles and the ‘madness of crowds’ Newton referred to.</p></section><section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec2"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2 </span>Super-Humans Against Nature and the Rationality Assumption</h2><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec3"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2.1 </span>A Single Random Event</h3><div class="Para" id="Par5">Imagine a very simple game against nature.<blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p class="Para" id="Par6">Coin toss: First, human bets on one side of the coin, heads or tails. Then, in the coin toss, nature shows one side of the coin.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn1" id="Fn1_source">1</a></sup>
</p></blockquote>
</div><p class="Para" id="Par8">Many people see the throw of a dice or a coin toss as a prime example for natural randomness. For at least 5000 years, our ancestors used randomization devices.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn2" id="Fn2_source">2</a></sup> But is a coin toss really random? This goes back to an age old discussion culminating in the question whether the world is predictable or unpredictable; whether everything is predetermined, or whether nature is inherently stochastic. During the Age of Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution, Isaac Newton’s advances in mechanics suggested that the universe is predictably governed by simple physical laws. This lead to the lofty notion that, one day, humans might be able to take full control over their fate with a world formula. In 1814, the French astronomer and mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace famously described the idea of scientific determinism as a perfect intelligence for which there exists no uncertainty (Laplace <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR21">1814</a></span>).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn3" id="Fn3_source">3</a></sup>
</p><p class="Para" id="Par11">Laplace’s Demon, as his notion became known, comes close to the definition of rationality in game theory. A completely rational agent is a super-human, an artificial construct that comes in handy when economists and game theorists need to build models. Like Laplace’s Demon, this super-human knows everything (‘perfect knowledge’) and can compute even the most complex problems with lightning speed. Another feature of this super-human is that she always strives to maximize her own utility.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn4" id="Fn4_source">4</a></sup>
</p><p class="Para" id="Par13">In Laplace’s scientific determinism, a coin toss is a quite boring affair. So would be Roulette or wheels of fortune. A super-human would simply know what side of the coin nature would show and bet accordingly. Scientific determinism remained the official dogma throughout the 19th century. This drastically changed with the ‘probabilistic revolution in physics’ initiated by statistical mechanics in the mid nineteenth century and continued by quantum mechanics in the early twentieth century (see Lüthy and Palmerino in this book).</p><p class="Para" id="Par14">But even without assuming unpredictable quantum states in quantum systems we may not be able to forecast with certainty, even in Laplace’s deterministic world. Early works, for example, by Henry Poincaré have shown that, in deterministic systems, infinitesimally small changes in starting conditions can produce unpredictable outcomes.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn5" id="Fn5_source">5</a></sup> This insight is the foundation of deterministic chaos theory and it took nearly a 100 years for the ‘chaos revolution’ to fully unfold. In the late 1960s, the MIT meteorologist Edward Lorenz discovered what is commonly referred to as the ‘butterfly effect’.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn6" id="Fn6_source">6</a></sup> In the 1970s, several mathematicians proved that simple nonlinear dynamic systems can produce irregular long run behavior and chaotic behavior without external random disturbance (Ruelle and Takens <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR38">1971</a></span>; Li and Yorke <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR22">1975</a></span>).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn7" id="Fn7_source">7</a></sup> In nonlinear dynamic systems, predictions about the future become progressively worse when we do not have absolutely perfect knowledge of the initial state. Thus, even after the discovery of quantum physics, chaos theory re-introduced indeterminism ‘through the back door’ and at a surprisingly fundamental level.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn8" id="Fn8_source">8</a></sup>
</p><p class="Para" id="Par19">We will come back to deterministic chaos in complex systems in Sect. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Sec14">5.3</a></span>. For the time being, it is important to note that, according to quantum physics, but also to chaos theory, even a perfectly rational Laplacian super-human—without any restriction in knowledge and cognition—would approach a simple coin toss against nature in the same way as normal humans would: as a game of pure chance. This is in line with game theory where a perfectly rational agent is still exposed to randomness. When facing a coin flip, a rational decision maker, even when equipped with perfect knowledge, will not know whether the outcome will be head or tails.</p></section><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec4"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2.2 </span>Repeated Random Events</h3><div class="Para" id="Par20">Fortunately, once faced with many independent coin tosses, our perfectly rational super-human can forecast the future very well.<blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p class="Para" id="Par21">Repeated coin toss: We start with no money and every minute nature offers us a coin toss where we can either win one dollar (heads) or lose one dollar (tails). Our lifetime wealth then develops according to what is known as a ‘random walk’: we start at zero and might win a dollar, then another dollar (two dollars of wealth), then we may lose five dollars in a row (minus three dollars wealth), but then we win some money again, and so on.</p></blockquote>
</div><p class="Para" id="Par22">What is our average lifetime wealth? According to the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem we can be almost certain to have earned an average of zero. Why? We have an equal chance to win or lose one dollar, on average, zero dollar. With millions of coin tosses, the gains and losses almost perfectly cancel each other out. On average, we expect to gain or lose nothing. We therefore also say that the expected value of such a coin toss is zero.</p><p class="Para" id="Par23">There is a catch, however. An expected value of zero dollar does not mean that we actually receive zero dollar. The expected value of a single coin toss is zero, but we still know for sure that the outcome will not be zero. Equally, just because we know that the average wealth over our life time is going to be very close to zero, our final wealth at the end of our life-time will most probably not be zero. In fact, our final wealth will probably be substantially above or below zero. Our final wealth is not an average but a single realization and it is impossible to predict this exact point. Hence, even if we are confident in predicting averages, we are not very good at exact point predictions.</p><div class="Para" id="Par24">Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">1</a></span> shows this intuitively with a Galton board, named after the English scientist Sir Francis Galton. The horizontal position of the red ball dropped into the Galton board represents the wealth level and the pegs represent the coin tosses. Every time the red ball hits a peg there is an equal chance to fall to the left hand side (loss of one dollar) or the right hand side (gain of one dollar). Each red ball follows a random walk and many of these random walks (red balls) produce a binomial distribution of final wealth levels, as approximated by the distribution of red balls at the bottom of the Galton board. As binomial distributions are symmetric, the expected value of random walks, the average, is zero (the middle slot at the bottom). The large majority of the red balls, however, does not land in the middle slot. Therefore, although we can be quite sure to expect an average of zero wealth, individual final wealth levels are most probably not zero and the exact final wealth level (final slot) of one single ball is unpredictable.<figure class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO1"><img alt="../images/340096_1_En_4_Chapter/340096_1_En_4_Fig1_HTML.gif" src="../images/340096_1_En_4_Chapter/340096_1_En_4_Fig1_HTML.gif" style="height:26.62em"/></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Fig. 1</span><p class="SimplePara">Galton board</p></div></figcaption></figure>
</div></section><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec5"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">2.3 </span>Risk Preferences</h3><p class="Para" id="Par25">How much would we bet on a single coin toss against nature in which we can win or lose one dollar? This depends on our risk preferences. The expected value is zero, so if we are risk-neutral we should offer the expected value, which is zero. This makes us indifferent between playing the game or not. But we might be risk-seeking. As the final wealth level of a single coin toss is certainly not zero, we might want to bet on the positive outcome of the coin toss and pay anything from 1 to 99 cents for playing the game. How much we are willing to pay for playing the coin toss is an indication of our risk-seekingness. Conversely, we might have a preference to prevent losses and to—at least partially—safeguard our current wealth level. In this case we are risk-averse and we require nature to pay us some amount from 1 to 99 cents to take the risk (play the game). The more risk averse we are, the more attractive nature must make the game for us to accept it. So, how much we are willing to pay/accept to play the game depends solely on our personal risk preferences. This also applies to fully rational super-humans. We assume that personal preferences are given and stable, but heterogeneous across individuals. Rational players are not necessarily risk-neutral. They can have any risk preference and maximize their payoff conditional on their preference. Moreover, we can have different types of preferences, not only for risk, but also for altruism or equality or with regard to other economic and social dimensions.</p></section></section><section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec6"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">3 </span>Super-Humans Against Super-Humans</h2><div class="Para" id="Par26">The crucial characteristic of fully rational super-humans is that they have perfect knowledge about the rules of the game and know that this also applies to all other players, including the knowledge that they are also fully rational. The latter is called the ‘common rationality assumption’. Given this definition of rationality, let’s see what happens if two super-humans play the following game.<blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p class="Para" id="Par27">Centipede game: Two super-humans, Superboy and Supergirl, play ball with each other. Nature randomly gives Supergirl the ball. She can decide to throw the ball to Superboy, or not. If she passes the ball, Superboy can decide to throw it back, or not. The game is finished either after 100 passes or if one of the two players decides not to pass the ball anymore. Nature also puts a number on the ball and increases it by 10 with every pass. When Supergirl gets the ball from nature, the number on the ball is 10. After the first pass, Superboy catches a ball displaying 20 on it. With the next pass the number changes to 30, and so on. If a player decides not to pass the ball, s/he gets the number on the ball paid out in dollar and the other player gets the same number divided by 10. Hence, the holder of the ball receives 10 + <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> × 10 dollar and the other player <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq1"><img alt="$$ (10 + n \times 10)/10 = 1 + n $$" src="../images/340096_1_En_4_Chapter/340096_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq1.png" style="height:1.86em"/></span> dollar after <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">n</em> passes.</p></blockquote>
</div><p class="Para" id="Par28">Assuming that both players prefer to earn some money over nothing at all, how many passes do we observe between the two players? In game theory, analyses typically start at the end and then move backwards to the beginning. This is what we call ‘backward induction’. After 100 successfully completed passes, Supergirl will get the ball back and receive 1010 dollar. But Superboy can see this coming and therefore does not pass the last ball back. Then Superboy gets 1000 dollar and Supergirl 100. Knowing this, Supergirl would not even pass the second-to-last ball to Superboy. Knowing this, Superboy would not make the pass before that one, and so on. Hence, when Supergirl receives the ball from nature, she does not even do the first pass and takes the 10 dollar. Superboy receives one dollar.</p><p class="Para" id="Par29">Supergirl’s behavior is an equilibrium strategy. Under the common rationality assumption, Supergirl knows the equilibrium strategy of Superboy (keeping the ball) and she cannot benefit from changing her chosen strategy, while Superboy keeps his strategy unchanged. This applies to both players as none of the two players would pass the ball if randomly chosen by nature as first receiver. The current set of strategies and the corresponding payoffs constitute a Nash equilibrium, named after the mathematician and John Nash.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn9" id="Fn9_source">9</a></sup>
</p><div class="Para" id="Par31">Backward induction is often not very intuitive, which is one of the reasons why we have to assume super-humans. In many games only super-humans are actually able to ‘see’ the end of the game, keep it in mind, rationally backward induct, find the game-theoretical equilibrium strategy and finally play the corresponding equilibrium behavior flawlessly right from the beginning. Also, under the common rationality assumption we assume that everybody in the game is a super-human and everybody knows this. This takes all randomness out of the centipede game. Does this mean that randomness never plays a role for super-humans and always leads to determinism unless a mechanistic randomization device is introduced? Not quite. The point is that Supergirl may know everything about Superboy’s reasoning, preferences and incentives, but this does not mean that Superboy’s actions are always predictable. In fact, there are games where fully rational players want to be as unpredictable as possible.<blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p class="Para" id="Par32">Rock-Paper-Scissors: Supergirl and Superboy simultaneously choose either Rock, Paper or Scissors. Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock, Scissors beats Paper.</p></blockquote>
</div><p class="Para" id="Par33">Each strategy has a <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq2"><img alt="$$ 1/3 $$" src="../images/340096_1_En_4_Chapter/340096_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq2.png" style="height:1.86em"/></span> chance to win, <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq3"><img alt="$$ 1/3 $$" src="../images/340096_1_En_4_Chapter/340096_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq3.png" style="height:1.86em"/></span> chance to draw and <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq4"><img alt="$$ 1/3 $$" src="../images/340096_1_En_4_Chapter/340096_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq4.png" style="height:1.86em"/></span> chance to lose. If Supergirl thinks that Superboy always plays Rock she could beat him with always choosing Paper. But this is not a Nash equilibrium as Superboy could improve on this strategy set by always choosing Scissors. This, again, would lead Supergirl to always choose Rock, and so it goes round and round. The only equilibrium strategy in this situation is to mix the three options as randomly as possible in order to win a least in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq5"><img alt="$$ 1/3 $$" src="../images/340096_1_En_4_Chapter/340096_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq5.png" style="height:1.86em"/></span> of all tries, draw in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq6"><img alt="$$ 1/3 $$" src="../images/340096_1_En_4_Chapter/340096_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq6.png" style="height:1.86em"/></span>, and lose in <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq7"><img alt="$$ 1/3 $$" src="../images/340096_1_En_4_Chapter/340096_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq7.png" style="height:1.86em"/></span>. So, the solution to this game is to play sequences that are perfectly random and unpredictable, just like a three-sided dice would be.</p><p class="Para" id="Par34">This is harder than we think. Humans are not very good at simulating random patterns. For example, in ‘randomizing’ we often underestimate clustering. This is the so-called gambler’s fallacy, which describes the phenomenon that humans tend to expect a coin toss to show tails with a higher probability after a sequence of heads (Tversky and Kahneman <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR53">1971</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR54">1974</a></span>). In other situations we may fall prey to the hot-hand-effect (Gilovich et al. <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR14">1985</a></span>). Here, we tend to believe that a series of heads indicates a higher likelihood of heads in future coin tosses.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn10" id="Fn10_source">10</a></sup>
</p><p class="Para" id="Par36">Of course, Supergirl and Superboy can randomize perfectly so that both win, draw and lose with equal probability over the long run. But as a thought experiment, let’s take the Laplacian view to the extreme and see what would happen if fully rational super-humans would really know <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">everything</em> with absolute certainty. What would happen if the brains of two players are two completely transparent randomization devices (we basically see all neurons fire) and both players are able to perfectly anticipate—as a point prediction—what the other side will choose in the next round? In this situation, the only equilibrium strategy for both players would be to always play the same as the other so that every game ends in a draw.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn11" id="Fn11_source">11</a></sup> But what happens if a draw is not an option?</p><div class="Para" id="Par38">
              <blockquote class="BlockQuote"><p class="Para">Matching pennies: Supergirl and Superboy each choose either heads or tails simultaneously. So, they both toss a virtual coin. Supergirl wins if the two coins match (heads and heads or tails and tails). Superboy wins in all other cases (coins do not match).</p></blockquote>
            </div><p class="Para" id="Par39">As in Rock-Paper-Scissors the Nash equilibrium is a mixed equilibrium strategy where both players have to perfectly randomize in order to win/lose half the time. Draw, however, is not an outcome. Thus, if super-humans could perfectly look into each other’s brains, both players would constantly point-predict the opponent’s intention for the next move, update, change their own intentions and point-predict again, only to realize that the opponent’s intention has changed accordingly, and so on. In this setting, both players are frozen in an infinite optimization without the ability to act. This may be where free will or emotions are ultimately needed as ‘circuit-breaker’. It may be that “to make a decision, emotion is the necessary trigger (and) without emotion, one would be reduced to the state of an idiot savant who goes on endlessly calculating without the ability to make a choice” (Olsen <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR35">1998</a></span>).</p></section><section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec7"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">4 </span>Humans Against Humans</h2><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec8"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">4.1 </span>Bounded Rationality</h3><p class="Para" id="Par40">Rationality requires extreme assumptions concerning players cognitive abilities: perfect knowledge about all factors that affect the decision to be taken—so basically about everything—and virtually infinite computing abilities to derive rational expectations forecasts and optimal decisions. Needless to say that we are no super-humans. And needless to say that no economist seriously believes that human behavior is always fully rational. Rationality is only a benchmark model, but a very powerful one. It allows us to analyze benchmark behavior, which, under evolutionary pressure and over time, is theoretically more successful in dealing with nature and its randomness than any other model. Nevertheless, it is far from present in every human, in all situations, or at all times. In the 1950s, Herbert Simon advocated the concept of bounded rationality, a more realistic description of human behavior where agents have limited computing capacities and information (Simon <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR47">1955</a></span>). Instead of perfectly optimal decision rules, boundedly rational players use short-cuts, rules of thumb, or so-called heuristics to overcome ‘uncomputable’ problems. These heuristics are not necessarily optimal or perfect but in complex environments they may perform reasonably well (for a discussion see Gigerenzer and Selten <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR13">2002</a></span>). By using heuristics we inevitably make mistakes, which may be random but can also be biased.</p></section><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec9"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">4.2 </span>Beliefs</h3><p class="Para" id="Par41">As we cannot know everything, we are uncertain about the actions and beliefs (and beliefs about the beliefs) of others. This is commonly referred to as strategic uncertainty. Let’s assume that Superboy and Supergirl in the above ball game (centipede game) can actually make mistakes. In other words, they are not super-humans anymore but simply humans: Girl and Boy. Let’s also assume, that Girl, who received the ball from nature first, actually passes the ball to Boy. Remember that this is a move that super-humans would never do because it is no Nash equilibrium. However, as we now look at humans, there is a possibility that Boy receives the ball and suddenly has to form a belief about Girl’s motives for passing the ball. Here are some beliefs that Boy might hold about Girl:</p><div class="Para" id="Par42">

As the pot is increasing for both with every pass, Girl might expect that Boy colludes with her against nature. After the last pass, Girl and Boy would have extracted the highest possible profit from nature. For this, however, Girls would have to believe that Boy passes the last ball back to her (or have altruistic preferences).</p></div><div class="ClearBoth"> </div></li></ol></div>
              </div><p class="Para" id="Par46">Of course, the dilemma of the situation is that Boy does not know what Girl’s underlying motivation was when she passed the ball. Boy has to form a belief about Girl’s intentions, but he cannot know for sure. To make matters worse, in a world of many players, there are many possible beliefs and weighted mixtures of beliefs about each other’s underlying motivations.</p><p class="Para" id="Par47">With certain assumptions, game theory can deal with these situations. For example, let us assume that all deviations from the rational equilibrium are because of the first of the above reasons.

How are initial beliefs (priors) about others are formed under strategic uncertainty? How quickly do people learn and in which way?<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn14" id="Fn14_source">14</a></sup> A common assumption is that people form expectations and update their beliefs about the real state of the world according to some learning scheme (Sargent <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR39">1993</a></span>). Many studies in neuroscience, particularly in the area of sensorimotor control, suggest that our brain is a Bayesian prediction machine.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn15" id="Fn15_source">15</a></sup> We would not be able to catch a ball without continuous forecasting and updating of priors about its most likely trajectory (Doya <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR9">2007</a></span>). When it comes to cognitive processes, however, other studies have shown that we are not very good at Bayesian updating. For example, in the assessment of probabilities, people have been shown to neglect base rates (Kahneman and Tversky <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR20">1973</a></span>). In stock markets, investors seem to over- and under-react to different types of news (De Bondt and Thaler <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR8">1985</a></span>). Alternative models, for example, reinforcement learning and adaptive learning of simple forecasting heuristics or anchor and adjustment processes, are cognitively less demanding and allow for more errors (Kahneman <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR19">2003</a></span>; Tversky and Kahneman <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR54">1974</a></span>; Hommes <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR16">2013</a></span>). At the extreme end of the spectrum, some psychologists argue that beliefs come first and that the brain is nothing more than a chatterbox that rationalizes beliefs ex post. The brain looks for patterns in sensory data and infuses them with meaning, forming beliefs. Then, it primarily focuses on the selection of confirmatory evidence that reinforces those beliefs in a positive feedback loop.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn16" id="Fn16_source">16</a></sup>

In their experiments, however, Moinas and Pouget (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR31">2013</a></span>) find substantial trading of this worthless asset and the formation of significant price bubbles. Theoretically, the QRE povides the best explanation for this buying behavior (Moinas and Pouget <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR31">2013</a></span>). Traders seem to believe that their fellow traders down the line will make mistakes. It is therefore rational for them to speculate on such mistakes and buy the asset as long as the probability to sell it to someone next in line is high enough. This result is very much in line with the famous ‘greater fool theory’ (Long et al. <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR23">1990</a></span>), which suggests that rational traders buy overvalued assets in the expectation that a ‘greater fool’ down the line will mistakenly buy the asset at an even higher price.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn20" id="Fn20_source">20</a></sup> In fact, experimental tests show that individuals who speculate a lot in this game also produce stronger bubbles and crashes in more realistic and dynamic double auction trading environments (Janssen et al. <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR18">2015</a></span>).</p></section></section><section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec11"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">5 </span>The Madness of Crowds</h2><p class="Para" id="Par68">As explained in the previous section, speculators may try to ride a bubble in the belief that there are enough fools out there to buy them out. This can be a rational strategy and there are many scientific models that explain the existence of such rational bubbles in financial markets (see Stracca (<span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR49">2004</a></span>) for an overview). It seems that there are potentially enough greater fools out there for more professional traders to speculate on. Heterogeneous agent models in finance assume that market participants are very different, not only with respect to preferences but also in terms of market experience, financial literacy and speculative sophistication (Hommes <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR17">2006</a></span>). Empirical studies show that private traders, who are considered to be less sophisticated than professional traders, do not gain from their trading on average and actually underperform after deduction of transaction costs. Instead of (noise) trading, private investors could have made more money buy simply investing into a broadly diversified stock market index and do nothing (Barber and Odean <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR1">2000</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par69">Speculating on greater fools, however, entails the risk to exit the market too late when not enough fools are left to buy the overpriced stocks. To complicate matters it is possible that speculators feed on each other, mistaking purchases of other speculators as noise. As in the guessing game it is often hard to tell whether a winning bid was really smart or simply lucky, particularly when there is a lot of noise. Warren Buffet, one of the richest and most successful investors of all time, once warned: “Nothing sedates rationality like large doses of effortless money. After a heady experience of that kind, normally sensible people drift into behavior akin to that of Cinderella at the ball. They know that overstaying the festivities—that is, continuing to speculate in companies that have gigantic valuations relative to the cash they are likely to generate in the future—will eventually bring on pumpkins and mice. But they nevertheless hate to miss a single minute of what is one helluva party. Therefore, the giddy participants all plan to leave just seconds before midnight. There’s a problem, though: They are dancing in a room in which the clocks have no hands.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn21" id="Fn21_source">21</a></sup>

The answer is that, although professional traders and sophisticated speculators may not be greater fools, even they cannot beat the market in the long run, which makes them fools, too; maybe lesser fools, but fools after all. This notion is a direct implication of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), which states that nobody can systematically beat the market. The value of a financial asset is defined by its expected future cash flow, discounted to its present value. Through the market mechanism, all relevant forecasts of market participants are compounded in market prices. If financial markets are efficient, which means that all information about possible future states of nature and cash flows are impounded in market prices instantaneously, then the residual price movements must be triggered by genuine surprises, which nobody has seen coming and which are therefore, by definition, a random walk (Fama <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR10">1965</a></span>).</p><div class="Para" id="Par72">For a graphic representation, let’s extend the Galton board in Figure 0 to 1000 rows of pegs, run a couple of balls through it and track their paths.

</div><p class="Para" id="Par74">As the EMH predicts, the random walks in Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">3</a></span> have a high resemblance with stock price charts. In fact, some surveys indicate that stock market traders and other financial professionals cannot reliably tell the difference between random walks and real stock price developments (Siegel <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR46">2013</a></span>). Many studies in financial economics show that the performance of the vast majority of financial professionals is due to (random) luck and not skill (Fama and French <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR11">2010</a></span>; Malkiel <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR25">1995</a></span>). Luck to be active in a certain period and in a certain class of investments. As a famous multi-annual experiment by the Wall Street Journal showed there is a very high likelihood that a dart-throwing monkey is an equally ‘skilled’ stock market forecaster as professional investment advisers (Porter <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR37">2005</a></span>). If an investment manager has an exceptional track record of past investments, there is a good chance that we have met the upper outlier random walk in Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">3</a></span> and not somebody who can consistently predict super-investments that others simply did not see. The catch with random walks is that the expected value of all future coin flips does not change and always remains zero, no matter at which point we currently are. This is what mathematicians and finance scholars call a ‘martingale’: at each point in a realized random sequence, the conditional expectation of the next value in the sequence is equal to the current value, irrespective of the preceding sequence. The martingale property of asset returns in efficient financial markets is the reason why governments warn clients that past investment performance provides no indication for the future. Unfortunately, too many investors believe that significant positive deviations from the x-axis are a signal of skill and not luck (Hoffmann and Post <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR15">2014</a></span>).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn23" id="Fn23_source">23</a></sup> In doing so, they fall prey to the self-attribution bias, which is the tendency to attribute success to one’s own disposition and failure to external forces (Miller and Ross <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR30">1975</a></span>; Feather and Simon <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR12">1971</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par76">The prevalence of the EMH is the reason why traders say that there is ‘no free lunch at Wall Street’. You cannot simply predict future stock prices from some charts (its preceding sequence) and make some easy money. Even news, when publicly available, cannot be used as forecasting and trading advantage as it is almost instantaneously compounded in the market price. In many financial markets computer algorithms are involved in more than half of all financial transactions. Algorithms trade in milliseconds, impounding new information in prices much quicker than any human trader could, which has a positive effect on the informativeness of prices (Chaboud et al. <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR6">2014</a></span>).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn24" id="Fn24_source">24</a></sup>

There is a broad consensus in the academic finance community—including many critics of the EMH—that, because of the efficiency of most financial markets, it is very hard, if not impossible, for traders to systematically beat the market (Stracca <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR49">2004</a></span>).<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn25" id="Fn25_source">25</a></sup> In the end we are all greater or lesser fools in light of the self-produced randomness on financial markets.</p></section><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec13"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">5.2 </span>No Free Lunch <span class="InlineEquation" id="IEq25"><img alt="$$ \boldsymbol{\ne} $$" src="../images/340096_1_En_4_Chapter/340096_1_En_4_Chapter_TeX_IEq25.png" style="height:1.86em"/></span> the Price Is Right</h3><p class="Para" id="Par80">The EMH is probably the most powerful and, at the same time, most hotly debated principle in Finance. This was demonstrated in 2013, when the Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to three eminent scholars: Eugene Fama, father of the EMH; Robert Shiller, an outspoken critic of the EMH, and Lars Peter Hansen, who offered an econometric compromise between the two. The EMH has two implications: one is that we cannot beat the market (no free lunch); the other is that, because of this informational efficiency, the market price we observe is a correct estimate of a financial asset’s future cash flows a.k.a. its fundamental or intrinsic value (the price is right). The former looks at price changes (returns), the latter at price levels. In the former we are in a world of arbitrage which exploits temporary differences between prices.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn26" id="Fn26_source">26</a></sup> In the latter we are in a world of market timing, over-/undervaluation and mean reversion, which exploit differences to fundamental values. It is the latter of the two worlds in which we believe to observe ‘madness’ in markets: bubbles and crashes that—with hindsight—seem to be everything but ‘the right price’.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn27" id="Fn27_source">27</a></sup> As much as financial scholars agree on the former, that we cannot beat the market, they are critical about the latter, the claim that the price is always right (Stracca <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR49">2004</a></span>).</p><p class="Para" id="Par83">To unravel this apparent contradiction we have to understand that the EMH rests on three, progressively weaker conditions, any one of which will lead to market efficiency: (i) full rationality, (ii) independent deviations from rationality, and (iii) unlimited arbitrage (Shleifer <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR44">2000</a></span>). Proponents of the EMH argue that, even if conditions (i) and (ii) do not hold, which is widely accepted, any systematic pricing errors (biases) will be arbitraged away by more sophisticated traders. Critics of the EMH argue that the potential of arbitrageurs to reduce mispricing is limited: arbitrage is not riskless, in many situations there exist severe liquidity constraints to arbitrage against the market, and arbitrage requires substantial investments in ICT, real-time data, and human capital to succeed in a very competitive business (Shleifer and Vishny <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR45">1997</a></span>). Hence, even if there is no free lunch, because the market does not offer any <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">feasible</em> arbitrage opportunities, this does not necessarily lead to a convergence of prices to fundamental values (Stracca <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR49">2004</a></span>). This has been demonstrated by Robert Shiller, who is well-known for his early warnings of a housing price bubble in a comparatively inefficient market with very limited arbitrage possibilities.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn28" id="Fn28_source">28</a></sup> A related criticism is that arbitrage is limited, because arbitrageurs themselves are boundedly rational. Then less rational traders (greater fools) are driven out of the market by more rational traders (lesser fools) so that nobody can beat the market anymore, but this does not exclude that assets are mispriced. Overall, “the existence of a pricing bias due to behavioral factors is indeed fully compatible with rational expectations and a random walk behavior of asset prices” (Stracca <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR49">2004</a></span> p. 395).</p></section><section class="Section2 RenderAsSection2" id="Sec14"><h3 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">5.3 </span>From Mispricing to Madness</h3><p class="Para" id="Par85">An important difference between economics and natural sciences is that today’s economic decisions and actions depend on today’s beliefs and expectations about the future (which again can differ from tomorrow’s belief about the future). The predictions, expectations or beliefs of agents about the future are part of a highly endogenous, dynamic and nonlinear feedback system which requires a <em class="EmphasisTypeItalic ">theory of expectations</em> (Hommes <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR16">2013</a></span>). An early and mathematically very elegant theory of expectations was the rational expectations hypothesis (Muth <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR33">1961</a></span>; Lucas Jr <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR24">1972</a></span>): under assumptions of rationality this hypothesis provides a rational expectations equilibrium (REE), where expectations and realizations, on average, coincide. Theoretically, in an efficient market with risk neutral agents, prices correctly reflect all possible future states of an asset’s cash flows (discounted at the risk free rate) and their true, physical (objective) probabilities. Hence, from efficient risk neutral market prices we can infer state price probabilities that coincide with objective probabilities.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn29" id="Fn29_source">29</a></sup>
</p><p class="Para" id="Par87">The REE refers to situations where we play Roulette with well-defined states, probability distributions and expected values. We refer to this kind of uncertainty as risk. Risk can be seen as a very special case of uncertainty, but it is not the norm. Most decisions in life are taken without knowing objective probabilities or all possible states, often referred to as ambiguity (Wakker <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR55">2010</a></span>). Ambiguous situations provide a fertile breeding ground for very heterogenous beliefs and expectations (Stahl <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR48">2013</a></span>) which agents have to learn about. As learning is not perfect, boundedly rational systems can be complex, nonlinear and dynamic (Hommes <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR16">2013</a></span>). In such an environment, strategic uncertainty about the beliefs and behavior of others can easily create nonlinear feedback cycles. This would not be a problem if the system eventually converges to the REE.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn30" id="Fn30_source">30</a></sup> There are many examples, however, where bounded rationality leads to deterministic chaos that makes predictions virtually impossible and forecasts become practically random. Econometric time series studies did not succeed in ruling out randomness in stock price data (or deterministic chaos) and there is strong evidence for nonlinear dependence (Hommes <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR16">2013</a></span>). Hence, while fully informed rational expectations are self-fulfilling in the REE, less informed prophecies can also be self-fulfilling in boundedly rational systems under ambiguity.</p><div class="Para" id="Par89">A typical example of such a feedback cycle are situations where fundamental values themselves are affected by market evaluations. To illustrate this, take a look at the market price of Tesla Motors as shown in Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig4">4</a></span>. In mid 2014, the electric car company is trading at a market value of more than half that of General Motors, Ford, and Honda. Each of those established companies had more than 50 times the annual revenues as Tesla. “Pure electric cars remain a niche market, making up &lt;1 % of total U.S. car sales. And within that, Tesla is a niche product. Its Model S costs about $75,000, while prices for the Leaf start around $30,000 and the Volt around $35,000.”<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn31" id="Fn31_source">31</a></sup> Moreover, in 2014 Tesla sold less e-cars than Nissan.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn32" id="Fn32_source">32</a></sup><figure class="Figure" id="Fig4"><div class="MediaObject" id="MO4"><img alt="../images/340096_1_En_4_Chapter/340096_1_En_4_Fig4_HTML.gif" src="../images/340096_1_En_4_Chapter/340096_1_En_4_Fig4_HTML.gif" style="height:19em"/></div><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Fig. 4</span><p class="SimplePara">Stock price of Tesla motors, 2010–2014</p></div></figcaption></figure>
</div><p class="Para" id="Par92">Is Tesla a bubble? Interestingly, Tesla’s CEO himself, Elon Musk, repeatedly remarked that he considered the stock to be overvalued (see quotes in Fig. <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig4">4</a></span>). Indeed, there are indications that the price is partially driven by speculation.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn33" id="Fn33_source">33</a></sup> It may therefore be rational, albeit risky, for investors to ride the bubble as long as others are still buying. In support of the latter, apparently many people believe that Tesla will lead a revolution in the car industry. In fact, the high share price, possibly also driven by pure financial speculation, provided enough funding for Tesla to make some very expensive investments in potentially game-changing projects.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" href="#Fn34" id="Fn34_source">34</a></sup> Thus, if shareholders’ beliefs have been over-optimistic originally, precisely this deviation from otherwise rational expectations, possibly reinforced by rational speculation, may have provided Tesla with the necessary capital to make their beliefs more realistic.</p><p class="Para" id="Par95">Even with hindsight it will be difficult to disentangle the underlying effects in Tesla’s stock price development. “There is often a tendency (probably because economists are themselves affected by hindsight bias) to regard a certain development caused by market developments as unavoidable (supporting the idea of exogenous rationality). But it can sometimes be the result of a self-fulfilling spiral in which the prime mover is indeed an ‘endogenous’ market whimsical move. (…) The issue of the feedback mechanism seems most relevant in this respect. Thus far, there has been no systematic attempt to address the issue of the feedback from market prices to fundamentals, and only some informal speculations have been provided (Shiller <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR41">2000a</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR42">b</a></span>; Daniel et al. <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR7">2002</a></span>)” (Stracca <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR49">2004</a></span>, p. 397).</p></section></section><section class="Section1 RenderAsSection1" id="Sec15"><h2 class="Heading"><span class="HeadingNumber">6 </span>Conclusion</h2><p class="Para" id="Par96">Interactions between people are rich in randomness, consciously produced or unintended. The fertilization of economics and finance with psychological ideas and evidence allows for new insights in dealing with randomness in human interactions, but it also adds to the risk of being less parsimonious (Tirole <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR52">2002</a></span>). A useful feature of many game theoretical models and the classical REE is that they impose a strong discipline on the degrees of freedom in economic models. Boundedly rational models run the risk of incorporating too much randomness and freedom as if anything goes. “To avoid ‘ad hoccery’, a successful bounded rationality research program needs to discipline the class of expectations and decision rules” (Hommes <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR16">2013</a></span>, p. 9). In doing so, and in order to understand ‘madness’ in markets, more investigation in social psychology rather than individual psychology is needed. We need to understand how randomness can be channeled at the aggregate level in social and economic systems, for example through the synchronization of expectations with improved market structures and communication (see, e.g., Shiller <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR41">2000a</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#CR42">b</a></span>).

First, utility is more than simply making money. Feeling happy, receiving love or any other positive sensation can also be a utility that people strive to maximize. This all depends on personal preferences. Given a choice between money and friendship, one person might prefer the former and another the latter. Second, a human can gain satisfaction (utility) from helping others. Did Mother Teresa only help others or also herself?
